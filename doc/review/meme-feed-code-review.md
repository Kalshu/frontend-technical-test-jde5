Readeability: 2/5
Split your code in sub function to improve readability and maintainability
Split index file in sub files to improve readability and maintainability
Split components in sub components to improve readability and maintainability
Don't use await in return line
Use const instead of let when possible
Don't forget to run lint

Performance: 2/5
Don't load everything in the first row, the first display should be as fast as possible
Don't load all pages at once, load them when needed (MemePage and CommentPage) to improve performance
Use ReactQuery to cache the data and avoid unnecessary API calls (getUserById)

Maintainability: 2/5
Caution to the await use, it will block the execution of the code until the promise is resolved and it slows down the execution of the code
Parallelize the calls to the API to improve performance
Avoid code duplication
Implement error handling in the code to avoid unexpected behavior
if possible, use a generated client to avoid manual API calls and improve maintainability
With generated client, you avoid errors in typing and you can use the API in a more efficient way

Don't implement component logic in the index file, use a component file instead
Use nested type instead a big object type with all the fields, this will improve the readability and maintainability of the code by the power of the typescript type inference
If you use a generated client, you can use the types generated by the client to improve the typing of the code
Don't use token to retrieve the userId, you can retrieve from the authentication context
